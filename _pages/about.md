I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan, School of Information. I expect to graduate in 2023. 


I am interested in modelling consumer and production behavior in markets with asymmetric information and peopleâ€™s individual and social preferences in social groups using theories in microeconomics, game theory, industrial organization, behavioral economics and social psychology. I conduct controlled laboratory experiments to test the models.


### Research Interests
Experimental and Behavioral Economics, Information Economics, Market Design, Industrial Organization, Game Theory
