Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Information, University of Michigan. My main research interests are behavioral and experimental economics, information economics, market design and game theory. I am interested in modelling consumer and production behavior in markets with asymmetric information and peopleâ€™s individual and social preferences in social groups using theories in microeconomics, game theory, industrial organization, behavioral economics and social psychology. I conduct controlled laboratory experiments to test the models.
