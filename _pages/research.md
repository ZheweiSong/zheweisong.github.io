## Working Papers

### 1. [Zhewei Song. (2022). "Sellers' Defensive Behavior in Credence Goods Markets with Uncertain Outcomes – Does Reputation and/or a Behavioral Nudge Improve Efficiency?" (Job Market Paper)](https://zheweisong.github.io/files/DefensiveTreatment.pdf)
In credence goods markets such as healthcare service markets, when a buyer encounters a problem that needs treatment, only sellers have the expertise to determine which type of treatment is sufficient to address the buyer’s problem. Although sufficient treatment maximizes buyers’ expected utility, sometimes it cannot guarantee a 100% success rate. When a treatment failure happens, buyers cannot determine whether it is caused by insufficient treatment or bad luck after sufficient treatment, and they may express their dissatisfaction with sellers in costly ways by engaging in “crying behavior” that result in compensation. To avoid the costly aftermath from such “crying behavior”, sellers will “defend” themselves by overtreating to minimize the probability of treatment failure. However, the high cost of overtreatment incurred by both sellers and buyers will result in a Pareto-inefficient outcome, as compared to the situation where buyers do not cry and sellers choose sufficient treatment. This study investigates whether this market inefficiency resulted from sellers’ overtreatment and buyers’ crying behavior can be alleviated through a reputation system and/or a behavioral nudge. I show that when there is a reputation system which makes sellers’ treatment history and buyers’ reactions publicly visible, there exists a perfect public equilibrium in which the seller and buyer frequently play the Pareto-efficient strategy profile. I also predict that a behavioral nudge, which makes salient the information that sufficient treatment and not crying lead to a Pareto-efficient outcome, encourage them to play the Pareto-efficient strategy profile. My laboratory experimental results show that most sellers overtreat while most buyers cry when neither reputation nor nudge is present. Buyers are significantly less likely to cry when the reputation system is introduced. When both reputation and nudge are present, sellers are significantly more likely to choose sufficient treatment and significantly less likely to overtreat in the late stage of the game, and market efficiency is weakly improved.

### 2.	[Zhewei Song & Ulrike Vollstaedt. (2022). "How the Market will Supply Better and/or Cheaper Products through an Optimal Product Testing Mechanism"](https://zheweisong.github.io/files/ProductTesting.pdf)
In markets where the true qualities of products are not visible to buyers, a product quality testing organization has expertise in finding out and revealing the true qualities to buyers. However, the quality testing organization often has limited testing capacity. In this study, we propose a quality testing mechanism which makes full use of the testing capacity to only test products that maximize consumer surplus. We show that with our proposed mechanism, the unique weak perfect Bayesian equilibrium maximizes consumer surplus, and thus our proposed mechanism (weakly) dominates any alternative quality testing mechanism. We also consider a generic benchmark mechanism in which the testing organization randomly selects products to test and reveal their qualities. Our experimental results show that the consumer surplus is significantly higher when the testing organization uses our proposed mechanism than when it uses the benchmark mechanism which randomly tests products.

### 3. [Zhewei Song & Erin Krupka. (2022). "When Group- and Self-Esteem Lead To ‘We-Thinking’: When Does Social Identity Motivate Group Behavior?"](https://zheweisong.github.io/files/Wethinking.pdf) Under review at *Experimental Economics*.
In this paper, we take as given that social identity motivates individuals to make group contributions and focus on examining the determinants of when it motivates these contributions. We test whether “we-thinking”, group-regarding behavior in the presence of an individual-group tradeoff, is predicted by a specific relationship between group- and self-esteem. We define group- and self-esteem as having positive feelings about the relative performance of one’s group and self. By extending Akerlof’s model (2016), we predict that engaging in “we-thinking” is positively correlated with group-esteem and negatively with self-esteem. We proxy for group-esteem and self-esteem using rank-based measures and self-reported measures. Using a laboratory experiment, we manipulate subjects’ group-esteem and self-esteem through intergroup and inter-personal competitions. We measure their engagement in “we-thinking” through a modified dictator game in which they allocate tokens to their group at their expense. Using the self-reported measures our predictions are supported: We find that subjects’ self-reported group-esteem (self-reported self-esteem) is significantly positively (negatively) correlated with engagement in “we-thinking”. Our results using the rank-based measure partially support the model’s predictions: Individual rank is significantly negatively correlated with engagement in “we-thinking” when group rank is high. The findings have implications for when individuals are likely to adopt group-regarding behavior and for how to measure the psychological concept of group/self-esteem.
