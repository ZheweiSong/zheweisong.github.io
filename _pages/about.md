<br/>
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Information, University of Michigan. I expect to graduate in 2023. I am interested in modelling consumer and production behavior in markets with asymmetric information and people’s individual and social preferences in social groups using theories in microeconomics, game theory, industrial organization, behavioral economics and social psychology. I conduct controlled laboratory experiments to test the models.

### Research Interests
Experimental and Behavioral Economics, Information Economics, Market Design, Game Theory, Socioeconomics
